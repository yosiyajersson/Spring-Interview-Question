# 1.what is the advantages of using 'spring boot' rather than 'spring' ?

Spring Boot is a framework built on top of the Spring framework that provides additional functionality and features that can make it easier and faster to develop applications.

Here are some advantages of using Spring Boot over Spring:

### Easy Configuration:
Spring Boot provides auto-configuration which makes it easier to configure the application. It also reduces the amount of boilerplate code that needs to be written.

### Faster Development: 
Spring Boot provides a range of pre-built components and modules which can be easily integrated into the application. This helps in faster development and deployment of the application.

### Embedded Server: 
Spring Boot provides an embedded server, which means that developers do not need to deploy the application on an external server. This makes it easier to develop and test the application.

### Dependency Management: 
Spring Boot provides dependency management, which makes it easier to manage dependencies in the application. It also helps in reducing conflicts between different versions of the same library.

### Integration with Other Tools: 
Spring Boot integrates with a range of tools such as Maven, Gradle, and Jenkins. This makes it easier to build, test, and deploy the application.

### Modular Architecture: 
Spring Boot provides a modular architecture which makes it easier to separate concerns and develop the application in a more organized manner.

Overall, Spring Boot can help in reducing development time, increasing productivity, and improving the quality of the application.
